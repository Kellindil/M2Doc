</p>
<p>
    Several stakeholders have relationships with the IFE system, they all have different goals.&nbsp;The focus is put
    here&nbsp;on the operational needs the IFE system will somehow contribute to. <strong>What is the precise scope or
    content of the IFE system is not&nbsp;elicited yet at this stage</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Discover the entities and their goals in his the operational capabilities diagram: <a
    href="hlink://_pmRnML2HEeSzuJ_4_7XgLw/">[OCB] Operational Capabilities</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Operational Architecture Diagrams provide a&nbsp;comprehensive view of the activities performed by the entities in
    order to reach their goals.

    <font size="4"><strong>System Need Analysis</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    The focus here is put on the IFE system itself. <strong>The objective is to set the boundaries and provide a clear
    vision of the need</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="hlink://_Q3xl4JTyEeSgObsjQ4XNVQ/">[MCB] All Missions and Capabilities</a> diagram&nbsp;shows on the
    capabilities of the IFE system. Three other diagrams provide interesting entry points to the model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="hlink://_LzrP8LclEd6PZMYM-Vvo5g/">[SC] System Actors</a>&nbsp;lists all the Actors (the aircraft is
        considered as an actor)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="hlink://_gaN78KyfEeSJ1PX7slxG4w/">[SDFB] Top Level Functional Overview</a>&nbsp;provides a first
        functional overview of what the actors actually do and what kind of exchanges they have with the IFE system
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="hlink://_xXSwEKv6EeSTJvLsyJitsw/">[SAB] Top Level System Overview</a>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;slightly refined
        version <a href="hlink://_TGdI0JZDEeS1n7CBuZtEDQ/">[SAB] High Level System Overview</a>&nbsp;are <strong>very good
        entry points to further navigate in the model</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Starting from these high level diagrams,&nbsp;a typical&nbsp;reading path&nbsp;is to dive into the function to
    visualize their refinement. For example, <a href="hlink://_Z-lO8LC1EeSAOqSI-4duBg/">[SDFB] [CTX] Run Services</a>. And
    recursively.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Using capabilities as a&nbsp;driver to browse the model is recommended</strong>. Some diagrams are specifically
    marked for that purpose, for instance <a href="hlink://_EsbcMLKzEeSZM9DbsSoyxw/">[SDFB] [CAPABILITY] Provide Video
    Entertainment Services</a>. From this capability covering VOD services to the passengers,&nbsp;browse the functional
    chains and scenarios to better understand how the capability is fulfilled.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional chains: <a href="hlink://_MOb7kJjJEeSFKIU85IonOQ/">[SFCD] Start Playing VOD Movie</a>, <a
        href="hlink://_m1AKgJjJEeSFKIU85IonOQ/">[SFCD] Resume VOD Movie</a>

    </li>
</ul>

    Check the global mode machine of the system with <a href="hlink://_M-eeYMIWEd6vqfXUNuD4FA/">[M&amp;S] IFE Operating
    Modes</a>. Among others, this mode machine is intended to specify under which operational conditions the IFE system is
    running. Another Mode machine is specifically modelled for what will become the Seat TV: <a

    <font size="4"><strong>Logical Architecture</strong></font>
</p>
<p>
    The Logical Architecture provides an intermediate design, hiding some of the implementation-dependent complexity.
</p>
<p>
    The main architectural drivers&nbsp;are explained in&nbsp;the <a href="hlink://_3blN8KK2Ed6k26nfEmjK4A/">[LCBD]
    Architecture Drivers</a>&nbsp;diagram.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another global view of the logical components is provided by <a
    href="hlink://_IGYnAKCeEeStTrLYjHtDEw/">[LAB] IFE System - All Components, CEs</a>
</p>
<p>
    Among others, the refined functional analysis is detailed in the following dataflow diagrams (<a
